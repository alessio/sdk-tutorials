# Instructions

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go 1.14 installed:

```
go version
```

Create a new directory and clone the repositories:

```
workdir="${HOME}/codewithus"
mkdir -p "${workdir}" ; cd "${workdir}"
git clone -b codewithus-1 https://github.com/alessio/cosmos-sdk-codewithus
git clone https://github.com/alessio/sdk-tutorials
cd sdk-tutorials/nameservice
echo "replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => ${workdir}/cosmos-sdk-codewithus" >> go.mod
go mod tidy
go mod download
go mod verify
```

You **don't need to set GOPATH manually** since, if unset, the `go` tool sets `GOPATH`
automatically to `$HOME/go`. Ensure `GOPATH/bin` is appended to the user's `PATH`
environment variable. The Right Way(c):

```
export PATH=${PATH}:"$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

You **don't need to set GOBIN manually** since `GOBIN` defaults to `$GOPATH/bin` if unset - [reference](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies).

# Build

Either

```
make
```

or

```
make install
```

The code generated by the gc compiler includes inlining of function invocations and registerization of variables.
These optimizations can sometimes make debugging with gdb harder Thus if you want to try out `gdb` or `gdbgui`, you
need to disable compiler's optimizations compile with `BUILD_OPTIONS=gdb`:

```
make BUILD_OPTIONS=gdb
```

# Start off

```
bash init.sh
./nsd start
./nscli rest-server --trust-node
```

# Debuggers and IDEs

## Delve

### Linux

Walk out the project path (e.g. `cd`) and run just:

```
go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
go get github.com/aarzilli/gdlv
```

Then `cd` back to the project directory:

```
cd -
```

### macOS


Make sure you have the compilation tools:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Walk out the project path (e.g. `cd`) and run just:

```
go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
go get github.com/aarzilli/gdlv
```

Then `cd` back to the project directory:

```
cd -
```
